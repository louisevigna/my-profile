				<h2><strong>Swimming</strong></h2>
					<p>I practiced competitive artistic swimming for 10 years in Le Pecq. I started this sport at 7 years old, completely unaware that is was going to become such an important thing in my life. Training every week for 10 years, 5 to 10 hours a week with the same teammates who became my sisters, was such a fulfilling experience. Being captain of my team for 4 years, from 2018 to 2022 taught me perseverance, organization, empathy and patience. I had the repsonsibility of at the same time motivating my team but also briunging the best out of every girl. Knowing their assets and perfecting them. I am very passionate about this sport for so many reasons. The swimming pool became my second home, feeling the water on my skin was comforting and my teammates helped me grow as a person.</p>

				<h2><strong>Make Up</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I discovered my passion for makeup only a year ago once again thanks to my sister. She worked at Sephora for a couple of months and introduced me to this diverse, creative, empowering world. I think makeup on a general note enables someone to feel good about themselves. Taking time to look at yourself, play with colors, shades… and do whatever you want ! Makeup can make you feel more empowered and confident because you took time to mke yourself look good. Makeup makes me feel like myself. I reveal my identity through makeuo. Wearing colorful shades, drawing shapes on my eyes… My creative side comes out and strangers can feel it. Doing my makeup is also very therapeutic. When I do my makeup, ut is my ‘alone time’. It allows me to spend time with myself, to think about what I will do during the day, and then to feel good about myself.

				<h2><strong>Languages</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I fluently speak english, french and spanish. French being my native language, I learned english from having english-speaking babysitters when I was a child. Studying in a bilingual school helped me perfect my english. However, I discovered my passion for languages thanks to my high school spanish teacher who made me fluent in spanish. I learnt spanish in two years and aspire to learn many more in the following years. Speaking a language allows to feel closer to the person speaking in front of you. Even though english in the common language, it is different speaking the native language of a country. For instance, when i spoke spanish in Spain last summer, I felt instantly closer to the spanish person in front of me. Some bond creates itself and this feeling is very fulfilling to me. The culture that comes with the language is also very interesting and rewarding.
